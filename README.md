Fastest way to get started:

1) Clone this repo to a server
2) Edit the /config/common.config.ini, providing at least a Mongo connection string and database name
3) Enable safemode in you common.config.ini and generate a password for the safemode user
4) Browse to your new site's admin at yoursite.com/admin and login with the safemode credentials
5) Start coding your front-end Theme :-)
